    <h1 class="head">Alan Turing: The Father of Modern Computing</h1>
    <section class="mainbody">
    <p>
        Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist who made 
        many revolutionary contributions to modern science and technology. In 1936, he developed the idea for the Universal Turing Machine, 
        the basis for the first computer, that later formulized the concepts of algorithms and computations. He made insightful contributions 
        to the idea of artificial intelligence through his creation of the Turing-test which determined if a machine was intelligent by asking 
        it a series of questions. Alan Turing is my inspiration and a rolemodel as he astronomically impacted  mine and the lives of countless others.

        Despite his acedemic prosperity and success, Turing faced numerous hardships. He was a gay man in a time of unfair laws against homosexuality. 
        In 1952, he was arrested for “gross indecency” and subjected to the treatment of hormone injections. Nevertheless he continued with his studies 
        and didn't let that distract him from his work. I consider him a hero becuase heros must use their strengths to improve the world while staying true to their values in the face of adversity.
